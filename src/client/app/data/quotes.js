  'Take it moment by moment, and you will find that we are all, as I’ve said before, bugs in amber.@Kurt Vonnegut',
  'Seeking what is true is not seeking what is desirable.@Albert Camus',
  'Au milieu de l\'hiver, j\'ai découvert en moi un invincible été.@Albert Camus',
  'Life has no meaning a priori… It is up to you to give it a meaning, and value is nothing but the meaning that you choose.@Jean-Paul Sartre',
  'Man cannot endure his own littleness unless he can translate it into meaningfulness on the largest possible level.@Ernest Becker',
  'If we believe in nothing, if nothing has any meaning and if we can affirm no values whatsoever, then everything is possible and nothing has any importance.@Albert Camus',
  'A weird time in which we are alive. We can travel anywhere we want, even to other planets. And for what? To sit day after day, declining in morale and hope.@Philip K. Dick',
  'Regardless of the staggering dimensions of the world about us, the density of our ignorance, the risks of catastrophes to come, and our individual weakness within the immense collectivity, the fact remains that we are absolutely free today if we choose to will our existence in its finiteness, a finiteness which is open on the infinite. And in fact, any man who has known real loves, real revolts, real desires, and real will knows quite well that he has no need of any outside guarantee to be sure of his goals; their certitude comes from his own drive.@Simone de Beauvoir',
  'Each suburban wife struggles with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husband at night- she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question-- \'Is this all?\'@Betty Friedan',
  'In life man commits himself and draws his own portrait, outside of which there is nothing. No doubt this thought may seem harsh to someone who has not made a success of his life. But on the other hand, it helps people to understand that reality alone counts, and that dreams, expectations and hopes only serve to define a man as a broken dream, aborted hopes, and futile expectations.@Jean-Paul Sartre',
  'Some care is needed in using Descartes\' argument. \'I think, therefore I am\' says rather more than is strictly certain. It might seem as though we are quite sure of being the same person to-day as we were yesterday, and this is no doubt true in some sense. But the real Self is as hard to arrive at as the real table, and does not seem to have that absolute, convincing certainty that belongs to particular experiences.@Bertrand Russell',
  'Today, however, we are having a hard time living because we are so bent on outwitting death.@Simone de Beauvoir',
  'After awhile you could get used to anything.@Albert Camus',
  'He who jumps into the void owes no explanation to those who stand and watch.@Jean-Luc Godard',
  'Without knowledge of what I am and why I am here, it is impossible to live, and since I cannot know that, I cannot live either. In an infinity of time, in an infinity of matter, and an infinity of space a bubble-organism emerges while will exist for a little time and then burst, and that bubble am I.@Leo Tolstoy',
  '"Where you come from is gone, where you thought you were going to never was there, and where you are is no good unless you can get away from it. Where is there a place for you to be ? No place. Nothing outside you can give you any place", he said. You needn\'t look at the sky because it\'s not going to open up and show no place behind it. You needn\'t to search for any hole in the ground to look through into somewhere else. You can\'t go neither forwards nor backwards into your daddy\'s time nor your children\'s if you have them. In yourself right now is all the place you\'ve got. If there was any Fall, look there, if there was any Redemption, look there, and if you expect any Judgment, look there, because they all three will have to be in your time and your body and where in your time and your body can they be?@Flannery O\'Connor',
  'A freedom which is interested only in denying freedom must be denied. And it is not true that the recognition of the freedom of others limits my own freedom: to be free is not to have the power to do anything you like; it is to be able to surpass the given toward an open future; the existence of others as a freedom defines my situation and is even the condition of my own freedom. I am oppressed if I am thrown into prison, but not if I am kept from throwing my neighbor into prison.@Simone de Beauvoir',
  'Deep within every human being there still lives the anxiety over the possibility of being alone in the world, forgotten by God, overlooked among the millions and millions in this enormous household. One keeps this anxiety at a distance by looking at the many round about who are related to him as kin and friends, but the anxiety is still there, nevertheless, and one hardly dares think of how he would feel if all this were taken away.@Søren Kierkegaard',
  '..he said firmly, "God can help you. All the men I’ve seen in your position turned to Him in their time of trouble." "Obviously," I replied, "they were at liberty to do so, if they felt like it." I, however, didn’t want to be helped, and I hadn’t time to work up interest for something that didn’t interest me.@Albert Camus',
  'What matters creative endless toil, When, at a snatch, oblivion ends the coil?@Johann Wolfgang von Goethe',
  'The day had been spent in the expectation of these hours, and now they were crumbling away, becoming, in their turn, another period of expectancy...It was a journey without end, leading to an indefinite future, eternally shifting just as she was reaching the present.@Simone de Beauvoir',
  'All she had to do was make the simplest of gestures - open her hands and let go her hold. She lifted one hand and moved the fingers of it; they responded, in surprise and obedience, and this obedience of a thousand little unsuspected muscles was in itself a miracle. Why ask for more?@Simone de Beauvoir',
  'Supposing there is no life everlasting. Think what it means if death is really the end of all things. They\'ve given up all for nothing. They\'ve been cheated. They\'re dupes."Waddington reflected for a little while. "I wonder if it matters what they have aimed at is illusion. Their lives are in themselves beautiful. I have an idea that the only thing which makes it possible to regard this world we live in without disgust is the beauty which now and then men create out of the chaos. The pictures they paint, the music they compose, the books the write, and the lives they lead. Of all these the richest beauty is the beautiful life. That is the perfect work of art.@W. Somerset Maugham',
  'I should like to be the landscape which I am contemplating, I should like this sky, this quiet water to think themselves within me, that it might be I whom they express in flesh and bone, and I remain at a distance. But it is also by this distance that the sky and the water exist before me. My contemplation is an excruciation only because it is also a joy. I can not appropriate the snow field where i slide. It remains foreign, forbidden, but I take delight in this very effort toward an impossible possession. I experience it as a triumph, not as a defeat.@Simone de Beauvoir',
  'Strangman shrugged theatrically. "It might," he repeated with great emphasis. "Let\'s admit that. It makes it more interesting—particularly for Kerans. \'Did I or did I not try to kill myself?\' One of the few existential absolutes, far more significant than \'To be or not to be?\', which merely underlines the uncertainty of the suicide, rather than the eternal ambivalence of his victim." He smiled down patronisingly at Kerans as the latter sat quietly in his chair, sipping at the drink Beatrice had brought him. "Kerans, I envy you the task of finding out—if you can.@J.G. Ballard',
  'This evening, which I have tried to spirit away, is a strange burden to me. While time moves on, while the day will soon end and I already wish it gone, there are men who have entrusted all their hopes to it, all their love and their last efforts. There are dying men or others who are waiting for a debt to come due, who wish that tomorrow would never come. There are others for whom the day will break like a pang of remorse; and others who are tired, for whom the night will never be long enough to give them the rest that they need. And I - who have lost my day - what right do I have to wish that tomorrow comes?@Alain-Fournier',
  'You know, everything\'s a sort of lie, and then you die.@Arthur K. Flam',
  'The sky both exists and doesn’t exist. It has substance and at the same time doesn’t. And we merely accept that vast expanse and drink it in.@Haruki Murakami',
  'God desires that man should be. God does not wish to be alone. The meaning of existence is the conquest of loneliness, the acquisition of kinship and nearness.@Nikolai A. Berdyaev',
  'If the existentialists are right, that life is meaningless, and if we acknowledge that, we are better equipped to find pleasure in small things.@Chloe Thurlow',
  'I\'ve lived the life of a man without teeth, he thought about it. A life of a man without teeth. I\'ve never bitten, I\'ve been waiting, keeping myself for later - and now I\'ve just ascertained that I don\'t have teeth anymore.@Jean-Paul Sartre',
  'Thus it amounts to the same thing whether one gets drunk alone or is a leader of nations.@Jean-Paul Sartre',
  'Life is tragic simply because the earth turns, and the sun inexorably rises and sets, and one day, for each of us, the sun will go down for the last, last time. Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have. It seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of death – ought to decide, indeed, to earn one’s death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life.@James Baldwin',
  'Battle day and night against the guile of oblivion...@Søren Kierkegaard',
  'The books we need are of the kind that act upon us like a misfortune,that makes us suffer like the death of someone we love more than ourselves, that make us feel as though we were on the verge of suicide,lost in a forest remote from all human habitation.@Franz Kafka',
  'Come, sleep and death; you promise nothing, you hold everything.@Søren Kierkegaard',
  'Life is merely terrible; I feel it as few others do. Often — and in my inmost self perhaps all the time — I doubt whether I am a human being.@Franz Kafka',
  'The things I believed in dont exist any more. It\'s foolish to pretend that they do. Western Civilization finally went up in smoke in the chimneys at Dachau but I was too infatuated to see it. I see it now.@Cormac McCarthy',
  'This very heart which is mine will forever remain indefinable to me. Between the certainty I have of my existence and the content I try to give to that assurance, the gap will never be filled. Forever I shall be a stranger to myself.@Albert Camus'
